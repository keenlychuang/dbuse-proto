    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.\n",

It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains.\n",

    "## Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source.\n",
